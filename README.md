#This is a online website which allows user to run the coding system like vscode,ellpicse on the mobile for coding for mobile users. 
#There is a website puter.com which does this but it can't run vs code online so i have made this prototype which can save the files directly to the google drive and progress also .
#while using this website when we click on any icon it will open and for closing that tab again click on that icon to close.
